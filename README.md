# Quantium-Retail_Analytics
As the part of the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Internship offered by Forage, I have worked on this data analysis project. It contains results of the completed tasks for the [Quantium Virtual Internship](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/quantium/data-analytics-rqkb), designed to replicate life in the Retail Analytics and Strategy team at Quantium, using Python.
