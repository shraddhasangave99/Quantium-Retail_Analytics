# Quantium-Retail_Analytics
  As the part of the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Internship offered by Forage, I have worked on this data analysis project. It contains results of the completed tasks for the [Quantium Virtual Internship](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/quantium/data-analytics-rqkb), designed to replicate life in the Retail Analytics and Strategy team at Quantium, using Python.

## Introduction
  Quantium has maintained a data collaboration with a major retail chain for several years, wherein the retailer furnishes transactional and customer data. As an analyst within Quantium's analytics team, the role involves delivering invaluable data analytics and insights to aid strategic decision-making.

  Retailers frequently adjust their store layouts, product assortments, pricing strategies, and promotional activities. These adaptations are aimed at addressing evolving customer preferences, staying competitive in the market, or seizing new opportunities. The Quantium analytics team plays a crucial role in assessing and analyzing the impact of these changes and advising on their effectiveness.
